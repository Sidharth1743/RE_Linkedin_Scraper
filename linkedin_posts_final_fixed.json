      "post_text": "It is with a heavy heart that I share that Michael (Mike) R. Quinlan, former CEO and Chairman of McDonald’s, has passed away.\n\nMike’s storied career with McDonald's began in 1963 as a summer mail clerk. In fact, he got his start at McDonald’s through a serendipitous connection, as he was the college roommate of one of June Martino’s sons. June, a legendary figure in McDonald’s history, was Ray Kroc’s first bookkeeper and played a pivotal role in shaping the franchise model.\n\nIn his more than 35 years with McDonald’s, he rose through the System, spending time in the restaurants and our headquarters to ultimately lead the business as President and COO in 1982, CEO in 1987, and Chairman of the Board in 1990.\n\nMike, affectionately known as “Q”, has a legacy that extends far beyond the boardroom. He was a passionate philanthropist and lifelong supporter of education. His generous contributions to Loyola University Chicago, where he studied and later served as Chairman of the Board, led to the creation of the Quinlan School of Business, Loyola University Chicago. He also championed community initiatives, including the construction of a Ronald McDonald House near Loyola’s Medical Center. Mike’s impact on our brand, our people, and our values will be felt for generations.\n\nWe extend our deepest condolences to Mike’s family, friends, and all who had the privilege of working with him. Let us honor his memory by continuing to lead with the same care, commitment, and courage that defined his remarkable journey.",

      "post_text": "When you put people first, everything else follows. This is the belief that guided Ray Kroc when he opened the first franchised McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, 70 years ago. It’s the belief that remains deeply embedded in our business, from our restaurant crew members to our franchisees to our suppliers to our corporate teams. \n\nReflecting on my ten years under the Golden Arches, my favorite memories are rooted in our restaurants and the incredible people who make McDonald’s a great place to work. In celebration of our 70th anniversary and Founder’s Day, I want to shine a light on the folks who keep Ray’s spirit alive in our restaurants and beyond. Each day, you make McDonald’s proud.  \n\nWhile we’ve evolved over the years, our shared commitment to our values and serving our customers and communities hasn't changed. I'm confident we will continue to make delicious feel-good moments for generations to come. #WeMakeMcDonalds",
